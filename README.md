==============================

## Assignment Description
Help Tank find Morpheus and the others in The Matrix by looking for patterns in its code.

Your task is to write a function, get_letter_frequency(), that accepts an 
arbitrary number of characters from standard input and returns a 
pointer to the root node of a MyMap containing the
number of occurrences for each character in the input, i.e., if the letter 'a' occurs
43 times in the input, map['a'] should return 43.


## Assignment Notes

You will implement a dictionary (abstract data type) using a binary search tree
data structure that will have similar functionality to std::map.

Deliverable: You must submit a file, `MyMap.hpp`, that contains the implementations of 
1. your MyMap functions and
2. get_letter_frequency()
